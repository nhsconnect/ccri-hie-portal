    # Introduction

    This project specifically supports the development of a digital end of life care interoperability capability, which uses a clinically-assured information standard <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/scci1580-palliative-care-co-ordination-core-content">SCCI 1580</a> to support the sharing of end of life care records.  It supports the development and a pilot implementation of the end of life care interoperability API which will allow sharing and updating of a digital end of life care record.  This work is based on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aimed at addressing the Urgent and Emergency Care use case.
